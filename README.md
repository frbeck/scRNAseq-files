Tissue types: By selecting a tissue you are looking at all genes that exhibit a certain fold change in one zone compared to the other two in that specific tissue type. </br>
Zones: By selecting a zone you are choosing to display genes which are highly expressed in a specific zone compared to the other zones.
Average FC cutoff: By setting this you are creating a threshold of differential expression. The only genes that will be displayed are those that meet this cutoff. </br>
All markers: This is the a list of all markers that meet the above listed criteria </br>
Shared markers: This is a list of all markers that meet the above listed criteria in all tissue types, but within the same zone. </br>
Differential markers: This is a list of all markers that only meet the above listed criteria in the selected tissue type, but no other tissue types of the same zone.
